   first, as an administrator we should set username/password first because that is more secure than post.
   secondly we post user name/password for a token
   finaly we use token to authenticate the identity for opreations
   
  one  of  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NDA1NzkwNDMsImV4cCI6MTU0MDU4MDQ4M30.uA0VsITqy9KN4uzes8E1KWE60OJ5QaN74e4nA1rZ5JQ"
